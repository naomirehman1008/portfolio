# Naomi Rehman's Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! This is a collection of projects I have worked on recently. I also have a private repository of my favorite academic projects, please email me at naomiarehman@gmail.com if you would like to see it.

#### Automatic Person Counter
This project automatically detects and records people boading and deboarding a bus. It uses C, C++, and two VL53L1X sensors to count passengers. 

#### Hardware Edge Detector
This project implements edge detection on an FPGA. It uses a 2D convolution with the Laplace kernel to detect edges, and USB and UART to send data between the host computer and the FPGA. The host program is in Python and the FPGA system is in SystemVerilog.

#### Single Cycle 16 bit CPU
This is a simple Verilog implementation of a single cycle CPU.
