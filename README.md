# portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! This is a collection of projects I have worked on, both academic and personal. Let me know if you have any questions!

# a note on academic/collaborative projects
Please do not distribute this repository or any of the projects, as some are from my coursework and contain code provided by the university that is not mine. I specify which files were written by me in the READMEs. For projects that were collaborative, I have removed the code that is not mine. Please let me know if you have questions or would like a demo.
