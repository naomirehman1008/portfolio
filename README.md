# Naomi Rehman's Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! This is a collection of projects I have worked on recently. I also have a private repository of my favorite academic projects, please email me at naomiarehman@gmail.com if you would like to see it.

#### Automatic Person Counter
I created this while working with PinpointAVL. It uses C, C++, and two VL53L1X sensors to detect boardings and deboardings on buses. 

#### Hardware Edge Detector
I created this project for CruzHacks 2024. It uses python and SystemVerilog to perform edge detection on an FPGA.

#### Single Cycle 16 bit CPU
This is a simple Verilog implementation of a single cycle CPU.
